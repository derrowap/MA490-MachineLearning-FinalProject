    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "In this study, we attempt to compare the power of neural networksâ€™ ability to mimic functions with the functions themselves. The Universal Approximation Theorem states that for any continuous function, there exists a feed-forward network with only a single hidden layer that can approximate it. This is motivation for us to try out different functions and try to train a neural network to accurately approximate as many as we can. For functions that are not approximated well, we can observe the function and try to learn more about neural networks as to why it did not learn the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the neural networks are able to extrapolate and perform well, we will try to analyze it's ability to be used in a business application. If neural networks are able to perform a function faster than the function itself, it could save a lot of money for companies that rely and quick computing. This has the possibility to introducing a whole new way of computing. Replacing functions with neural networks because sometimes the functions become too complex and take much longer than a neural network at executing."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "The overall objective is to explore the complexity of problems which are able to be solved by applying learning with neural networks. We have programmed several different functions in Python, all of which range in complexity. We can have a loop that feeds in a very large number of inputs to these functions and records the output in order to generate a large amount of data. The programs were made by us so we can generate as much data as we need to train the neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this data, we will use supervised learning by feeding the network with the input data and using back-propagation to update the weights in the network. The neural network will be programmed using skFlow from TensorFlow's library."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "Since all functions are written by us, we are able to generate all possible inputs in a given range for each function and record the output. This allows us to have as much data as needed to observe the performance of the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of how we will generate the data from the functions. Generating all possible examples will allow us to fully train the network as much as we can. We split the data, for example into 90% training and 10% testing, and test the fully trained neural network on the testing data to analyze how well it generalized the function."

    "The results seemed to show that iterating through every possibility multiple times and then training on that is the best method of data gathering. As with many things in this, you have to find the fine line of having the right amount of data without having too much. \n",

    "I knew that this function would be slower than Python's built in add, because it has to do matrix multiplication. I wanted to know how much slower. When adding low numbers, Python's add was up to 2000 times faster. As the numbers grew to be larger, however, Python's add was only a few hundred times as fast.\n",

    "I was interested in how far a neural net could extrapolate to numbers that it had never seen before. Although this should have been an easy problem because it is linear, it wasn't because SkFlow doesn't allow you to choose the activation function for your regressor. Most all of the single and double layer neural nets I trained failed around 200-300, however there was one that stood out and was able to correctly predict 1-1145 with just training on 1-100\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows how well the neural net is able to extrapolate after 100 steps, and after 10000 steps. After 10000 steps, the lines are very similar between the neural net and the real, however the neural net always starts to add not enough or a little too much everytime, stopping it's ability to extrapolate any further. It is worth noting, however, that the regressor knows that it is a linear relationship, and treats it as such.\n",

    "* Started by generating every possible 2x2 matrix with the integers 1-20\n",
    "* Ran MSE tests on every possible single hidden layer and double layer of increments 100 from 100-3000\n",

    "* Neural network only took 8-30 times longer to compute determinant than NumPy's determinant function\n",
    "\n",
    "My main goal when starting to look at determinants was to truly test the extrapolation power of the neural network that I was using. I wanted to train on a 2x2 matrix, and see if it could extrapolate to a 3x3. However, I couldn't achieve good enough results from training on a 2x2. The poor results were with optimal conditions. I was able to train it on every possibility of integers from 1 to 20. I tested many different hidden layers. For one layer, below is a graph displaying the MSE after 10000 steps.\n",

    "![Determinant](./images/determinant.jpg)\n",

    "I decided to scrap the idea of even trying to do a 3x3, knowing that either I would have to train for very long because of the ammount of data I would have (20^9) if I were still using integers from 1-20. Resorting to using random integers produced an even worse result because there were too many cases that the neural network would never see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I would say that trying to train a neural network with SkFlow to learn how to compute a determinant was a failure in any practical sense because the lowest error that was produced was 45%. Training longer was not helping the neural net extrapolate further from the values that it had already seen, rather it was just learning every example that it saw. If that is the case, a lookup table would be more efficient and accurate."

    "We were able to train with reasonable accuracy on linear functions, continuous functions, and a sine function which has clear repetition. Some of them were able to extrapolate further past the training data, which tells us it did a great job at generalizing the function overall. Others we are currently unsuccessful with extrapolating much past the training data. We had a difficult time trying to find a function it was not able to approximate in the given training range. The only one unable to learn was an approximation function for the fibonacci sequence. The fibonacci sequence is best learned by a recurrant neural network, which is not in the scope of this class."
